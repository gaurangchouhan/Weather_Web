# Weather_Web
WeatherWeb is a simple weather web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for any city worldwide and view real-time temperature, humidity, and pressure using a weather API. This is my first fully functional web project, focused on strengthening frontend fundamentals and API integration.
